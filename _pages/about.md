<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hello! I'm Yuhan Liu, currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Machine Learning Department of MBZUAI, working with <a href="https://nilslukas.github.io"> Dr.Nils Lukas</a>,<a href="https://lahlou.org"> Dr.Salem Lahlou</a> and <a href="https://mtakac.com"> Dr.Martin Takac</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn"> Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence</a>, Renmin University of China, where I have been studying since 2021 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/GSAI_FACULTY/28026f7425324f61991c70d279372d13.htm">Rui Yan</a>. Prior to joining RUC, I earned my M.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Automation from China University of Petroleum (Beijing), where I was mentored by Prof. Jianjun Liu. I also completed a minor in English Speech and Debate at CUPB, under the guidance of Prof. Jie Lian.

<span style="color: #c00000;">**I am in the 2026 Fall job market and actively seeking faculty and postdoctoral opportunities.** </span>

# ❤️ Research Interest
My research interests include **_buliding safe and secure Agentic AI_**, focusing on:

* **Responsible Agentic System**:How to build a safe and secure Agentic System
* **Fake News and Social Systems**: Investigating the use of LLMs in addressing the propagation of fake news and their role in social dynamics.
* **VLMs and Reasoning**: Exploring complex reasoning paradigms in Vision-Language Models and their applications.
* **Societal Challenges of LLMs**: Exploring issues such as Hallucination, Hate Speech, Bias, and the alignment of LLM with societal norms and values.
