<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hello! I'm Yuhan Liu, a Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence at <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn"> Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence</a>, Renmin University of China, where I have been studying since 2021 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/GSAI_FACULTY/28026f7425324f61991c70d279372d13.htm">Rui Yan</a>. Prior to joining RUC, I earned my M.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Automation from China University of Petroleum (Beijing), where I was mentored by Prof. Jianjun Liu. I also completed a minor in English Speech and Debate at CUPB, under the guidance of Prof. Jie Lian.

<span style="color: #c00000;">**I am in the 2025 Fall job market and actively seeking faculty and postdoctoral opportunities.** </span>**Feel free to reach out to me at yuhan.liu@ruc.edu.cn !**

# ❤️ Research Interest
My research interests include **_LLMs and their application in Governance_**, focusing on:

* **Fake News and Social Systems**: Investigating the use of LLMs in addressing the propagation of fake news and their role in social dynamics.
* **LLM-related Challenges**: Exploring issues such as Hallucination, Hate Speech, Bias, and the alignment of LLM with societal norms and values.
* **Societal Impact**: Leveraging LLMs in sectors like healthcare, advertising, and recommendation systems for societal benefit.
* **Continual Learning**: Addressing the challenges of continual learning in LLMs to ensure they can adapt and improve over time.

My contributions have been recognized in several top-tier international AI conferences.
