<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hello! I'm Yuhan Liu, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn"> Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence</a>, Renmin University of China, where I embarked on my journey in 2021 under the guidance of Prof. <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/GSAI_FACULTY/28026f7425324f61991c70d279372d13.htm">Rui Yan</a>. Before joining RUC, I got my B.S degree in Automation and M.S degree in Mathematics, both from China University of Petroleum (Beijing), under the supervision of Professors Zhu Wang and Jianjun Liu, respectively.Additionally, I obtained my minor degree in English Speech and Debate from CUPB, supervised by Prof. Jie Lian.

My research interests span natural language processing and computational social science, with a focus on Human-centered NLP. I am particularly fascinated by the exploration of large language models' (LLMs) capabilities and their practical applications within the social sciences. My work primarily involves utilizing LLMs as agents in fields such as fake news propagation, financial market trading, and beyond. I am also deeply involved in studying in-context learning and knowledge enhancement in LLMs. Moreover, I am passionate about leveraging NLP for societal benefits, including the use of LLMs in sectors like advertising, recommendation systems, and fintech. Another area of my interest includes addressing continual learning challenges within LLMs. My contributions have been recognized in several top-tier international AI conferences.

For academic collaborations or inquiries, please feel free to reach out to me at yuhan.liu@ruc.edu.cn.
