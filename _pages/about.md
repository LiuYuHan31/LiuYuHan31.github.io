<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hello! I'm Yuhan Liu, a Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence at <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn"> Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence</a>, Renmin University of China, where I have been studying since 2021 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/GSAI_FACULTY/28026f7425324f61991c70d279372d13.htm">Rui Yan</a>. Prior to joining RUC, I earned my M.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Automation from China University of Petroleum (Beijing), where I was mentored by Prof. Jianjun Liu and Prof. Zhu Wang, respectively. I also completed a minor in English Speech and Debate at CUPB, under the guidance of Prof. Jie Lian.

**I am in the 2025 Fall job market and actively seeking postdoctoral and faculty opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me!**

My research interests include LLMs and their application in Governance, with a particular focus on Fake News, Multi-Agent Systems for Social Science, and issues related to LLMs, including Hallucination, Hate Speech, and Bias. I am particularly interested in exploring the capabilities of LLMs and their practical applications in these domains. My work primarily involves utilizing LLMs to address challenges in areas such as fake news propagation and their role in social systems. Additionally, I am passionate about leveraging LLMs for societal benefits, particularly in sectors like advertising, recommendation systems, and healthcare. Another area of my research is aligning LLMs agents with social behavior, ensuring that these models act in ways that are consistent with societal norms and values. I am also addressing the challenges of continual learning within LLMs, ensuring their ability to adapt and improve over time. My contributions have been recognized in several top-tier international AI conferences.

For academic collaborations or inquiries, please feel free to reach out to me at yuhan.liu@ruc.edu.cn.
